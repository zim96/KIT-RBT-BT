# zimRobot
I call my very first robot zimRobot, it is also my very first Arduino project. Read more about it on my blog : [Abdul Hazim's Blog](https://abdulhazim.wordpress.com/2019/03/17/simple-robot-using-arduino-for-rm100/)

## 6-Feb-2019 (version 1.0)
* Sensors report data over USB Serial and Bluetooth Serial
* Robot can be controlled over USB Serial and Bluetoot Serial
* Robot avoids hitting obstacles when user tries to run it into the obstacle

## Feature ideas
* Automatic navigation around a room to log temperature data
  * May need to add micro-switches to know if obstacle is hit
* Dedicated interface over Bluetooth to control robot and log it's sensor data

# KIT-RBT-BT (Original)

Everyone loves mobile robot :) This is mobile robot kit based on Maker UNO(Arduino UNO compatible). Learning electronics, sensor, microcontroller and coding together, not to forget having fun too!

The kit comes in loosen parts, so you will need to assemble it. This is special mobile robot kit because it has Bluetooth module so you can control it with mobile phone and we have steps to control it from smart phone apps! Of course your smart phone must have Bluetooth :) Every phone should have Bluetooth nowsaday.

With the beginner friendly Maker UNO as the controller, everyone can build and program this mobile robot. We have also included dual channel motor driver, with custom designed acrylic base + two "TT" brush motor. Not to forget we also include 4 x AA battery to power the controller and motor. Of course it has Bluetooth module too :)
